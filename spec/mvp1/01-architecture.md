## Dependency direction

```text
cli -> app -> domain
youtrack -> app ports + domain
output -> domain
config, credentials, skill -> independent utilities
```

Forbidden dependencies:

- domain -> CLI/config/YouTrack
- app -> REST DTOs
- CLI -> REST DTOs
- output -> REST DTOs

Interfaces are declared by their consumer in `internal/app/ports.go`.

## Main application ports

`IssueStore` provides read/update/move/tag operations. `ProjectFieldStore` provides project field definitions, bundle values, and allowed field users. `ProjectStore`, `TagStore`, `UserStore`, and `GroupStore` provide reference resolution. `BoardStore` resolves semantic Board memberships and validates/applies Board command changes.

Application services receive those interfaces and never instantiate HTTP/config clients themselves.

## Mutation model

Application code builds an `IssuePatch` containing summary, description, resolved custom-field assignments, and an optional complete desired tag set. Board membership is a semantic multi-valued synthetic field and remains outside `IssuePatch`; its adapter owns sprint/agile and command wire shapes.

Combined edit flow:

```text
GET issue + issue sprints
 -> load/cache project metadata
 -> resolve every custom field, Board value, and tag
 -> validate Board command assist and all changes
 -> optional POST /api/issues/{issue}
 -> optional POST /api/commands for Board
 -> GET issue + issue sprints
```

Successful Board edits use the issue POST before the command POST. They are validation-safe but not transactionally atomic: a command execution failure does not roll back a successful issue POST.

A validation error before the POST must leave the issue untouched.

## Command-scoped caches

The field resolver caches within a command invocation:

- project field definitions
- bundle options
- allowed field users
- current authenticated user

No persistent cache is part of MVP1.

## Concurrency

Mutation operations are sequential. Do not parallelize writes. Metadata lookup optimization is secondary to predictable behavior.
